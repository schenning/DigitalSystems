\section{Simulating}

\begin{itemize}

\item The signal a are active four times on the rising edge of the clock.
\item It must be ingnord one time (the second intance of active a) during the simulation period since the macro-cycle is already running. The third time a is high, the new macro cycle does not start, and that is not the correct behaviour according to the spesifications.
\item  The bug in the g1.vhd got fixed by: \begin {lstlisting}
if a='0' then
        clk = '1' and clk'event and a = '1' ;
    end if;
\end{lstlisting}
One could also use: 
 \begin {lstlisting}
 if not(clk='1' and clk'event a='1') then
\end{lstlisting}
\item As expected the signal assignments are exceuted on the same physical duration, but with one delta-cycle delay.  

\end{itemize}

\section {Bonus}
\begin{itemize}
\item The g1.vhd with synchronous, active high, reset signal is added in directory. 
\end{itemize}
