Question #1.1

This is a Moore Machine
Between the rising edge of the clock, if you change the primary input, you don't change the primary input.  

Question #1.2

The state machine has 16 states: 

IDLE, READY, BUSY AND WAIT, and in each of the, the internal variables can
have the values ack and pass_token.




Question #1.3
As there are 16 states we minimum need 4 one-bit registers


Question #1.4
16

Question #1.5
The initial state is the IDLE state

Question #1.6
See attatched figure



Question #1.7

There are 11 theoretical states reachable from the initial state.
- In the IDLE-state, the variables pass_token can take on two different values. 
- In the READY-state, ack can only have one value. 
- In the BUST-state, ack and pass_token can only have one value. 
- In the WAIT-state, pass_token can  take on two different values. ack is not changed. 

This adds up to: 

4 (states) + 2 +1 +2+2 = 11 teoretical states




PROBLEM #2

QUESTION #2.1 and QUESTION #2.2
The number of different models on top level are 2: arbiter and controller



QUESTION #2.3
The number of instances of controller model is 3: A,B,C





PROBLEM 3
QUESTION #3.1

Current instance name: controllerA


QUESTION #3.2

The names of the outputs and inputs of this instance are 


.inputs  id req sel 
.outputs ack pass_token





 
# Simulation vectors have been randomly generated


.inputs  id req sel 
.latches ack pass_token state 
.outputs ack pass_token 
.initial 0 1 IDLE 

.start_vectors

# id req sel ; ack pass_token state ; ack pass_token 

B 0 C ; 0 1 IDLE  ; 0 1 
B 0 A ; 0 0 IDLE  ; 0 0 
A 1 A ; 0 0 IDLE  ; 0 0 
X 0 A ; 0 0 READY ; 0 0 
A 1 A ; 1 0 BUSY  ; 1 0 
X 1 X ; 1 0 BUSY  ; 1 0 
X 1 B ; 1 0 BUSY  ; 1 0 
A 0 B ; 1 0 BUSY  ; 1 0 
B 1 X ; 0 1 WAIT  ; 0 1 
B 0 A ; 0 0 WAIT  ; 0 0 
# Final State : 0 0 WAIT
