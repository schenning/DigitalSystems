Simulating


Q 

- The signal a are active four times on the rising edge of the clock. 

- It must be ingnord one time (the second intance of active a) during the simulation period since the macro-cycle is already running. The third time a is high, the new macro cycle does not start, and that is not the correct behaviour according to the spesifications. 


- The bug in the g1.vhd got fixed by:

    if a='0' then
        clk = '1' and clk'event and a = '1' ;
    end if;

One could also use:

 if not(clk='1' and clk'event a='1') then
