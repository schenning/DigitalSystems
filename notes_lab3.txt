Problem 1

Question #1

"No two processes can access the bus at one time"

CTL-formula:

    AG!((ackA=1 * ackB=1) + (ackB=1 * ackC=1) + (ackC=1 * ackA=1));
		
Question #1.2

	--Goes to state 7:
ackB:0
arbiter.state:B
clientB.state:REQ
controllerB.state:IDLE
pass_tokenB:1
reqB:1

--Goes to state 8:
arbiter.state:C
clientC.state:REQ
controllerB.state:READY
reqC:1


Bug: The FSM has no control over the value of pass_token when the arbiter changes state.

Question #1.3

Set passtoken = 0 in IDLE state
 
Question #2
